# Introduction

This is the lab notebook of Brian L. Troutwine, or
[blt](https://github.com/blt/) depending on if you know me in the flesh or
online. I like to play optimization games and program computers and have managed
to make a living, so far, at doing both. I keep busy with a bunch of side
projects and research interests that don't necessarily involve computers and
figured that a less haphazard scheme for keeping my notes would be valuable to
me and probably of interest to other folks. I've took a lot of inspiration from
[James Munns](https://lab.jamesmunns.com/) who took inspiration from
[whitequark](https://lab.whitequark.org/).
