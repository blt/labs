# Writing and Talking

Over the years I've wrote and talked about a number of things, mostly
technical. I haven't been very careful about keeping an index of these things,
since to me they feel like a kind of rocket exhaust. Anyhow.

## Writings

### "Systems Programming for Normal People"

This is my in-progress book for No Starch press. The idea is to introduce
systems programming for practicing software engineers that may not have had
opportunity to work down-stack but would like an inroads. I am also trying to
orient the book toward what I see as the reality of systems programming today:
migration of complex kernel workflows into a hybrid userspace model,
minimization of memory copies, containerization and distribution.

## Talks

### Why Things Fail

[Bruce Tate](https://twitter.com/redrapids) and I were doing a video series for
a while called "Why Things Fail". One of my research interests is the failure of
complex systems and this series is me and Bruce having a conversation about one
serious failure in-depth. We've recorded three videos so far. We had planned to
talk about the [Dust Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl) but that got
interrupted.
